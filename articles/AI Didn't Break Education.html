                      <img src="girl-sitting-table-with-notebooks-reading.jpg" alt="Nature" class="responsive">

      <p class="blog-post-meta">July 4, 2025 by <a href="#">Turankok</a></p>
      
      <p>"AI is making education redundant!", "Cheating is too easy!" "Kids don't have critical thinking anymore…" are a few of the countless complaints about AI and its use in education. Pessimistic charts, outrageous examples of exploits all fuel this doomerism against artificial intelligence. Ever since the grandiose introduction of chatbots in our lives starting from 2022, the common discourse is either about unemployment or potential growth of numerous fields. Education, one of the areas that got impacted the most, is especially home to many heated arguments. Although AI is seen as the wild-card that broke education as we know it, it rather exposed the bleeding wounds of a century old system.</p>

      <blockquote>
        We destroy the disinterested (I do not mean uninterested) love of learning in children, which is so strong when they are small, by encouraging and compelling them to work for petty and contemptible rewards — gold stars, or papers marked 100 and tacked to the wall, or A's on report cards… in short, for the ignoble satisfaction of feeling that they are better than someone else…. We kill, not only their curiosity, but their feeling that it is a good and admirable thing to be curious, so that by the age of ten most of them will not ask questions, and will show a good deal of scorn for the few who do.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Thus said the prominent author and educator, John Holt, in the year of 1964! His criticism towards the system is still valid more than 60 years later. The reason I quoted this is to show that we, who wish for a better education quality, are dealing with the same problems as those who came generations before us. Yes, students need to have higher critical thinking skills. Sure, X (in our day it is AI) is making learning too easy and trivial. However, that same discourse happened many times before with Wikipedia and the Internet itself. As an extreme example, Socrates criticized the invention of writing because it would make people rely too much on them and lose their ability to think and memorize! In his own words:</p>

      <blockquote>
        For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Indeed, Socrates did not write a single book in his life, and all we know about him is thanks to the notes of mainly Plato, and partly Xenophon and Aristophanes.</p>

      <p>So it is clear the discourse about increasingly easy access to knowledge is nothing new. At the same time, it is not surprising that students benefit from this positive trend despite the system. Just like how students today make Chatbots do the homeworks for them today, before that it was common to copy and paste stuff from barely relevant websites and changed the wording to escape plagiarism tools. But what is the cause? Students do not taught to value thinking itself because the system doesn't value it. It prioritizes productivity, grades, test scores, and competition. Despite the structure remains unchanged, new tools emerge. Moreover, although it is tempting to assume that older generations had higher critical thinking skills due to lack of "easy access to knowledge" it would be a bold claim when we have no comprehensive data about this.</p>

      <p>AI is not the reason, it is the symptom of a struggling, obsolete system. This turbulence is about the changing paradigms and epistemology. The system was built for memorization in the past, where the greatest virtue and intellectualism was about remembering and memorizing. The times changed, and now these approaches to being intellectual are becoming more and more obsolete with every new tool. New age requires to know how to access to knowledge, to evaluate it, and to use it creatively. However, current education continues on to treat learners like receivers. It still grades them based on how well they parrot back the information rather than requiring them to think in higher orders.</p>

      <p>We made learning so rigid, systematic and uncreative by making everything about standardized tests (this is true even when it's unintentional, see "Washback Effect".), and disciplined working-ready students. Human children are born with the most creative and curious brains, only to get wasted by unending grades, deadlines, obedience expectations and so on. AI is good at producing unoriginal mediocre content, which 'coincidentally' is in line with the demands of the current model! Children are not wrong to use AI to help them with this system that treats them like industrial outputs.</p>

      <p>What we are going through is indeed scary and will undoubtedly change what we understand from education, however, we should stop trying to fight the windmill that is AI, and instead focus on the flaws resulting from the banking model. Unstable education system, underpaid teachers and overcrowded classrooms are far greater threats to student learning.</p>

      <h2>Adaptability is key, not throwing the towel in</h2>

      <p>AI is already here and it's not going soon, therefore, We need to think about what we teach and why we teach, and adjust the teaching process to reward meaningful learning, rather than mundane tasks or tests.</p>
